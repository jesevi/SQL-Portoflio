  
Getting started, take a look at the startups table:

SELECT *
FROM startups;
How many columns are there? 

-- 10


Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM startups;
  
-- 70 

We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.

Calculate this by getting the SUM() of the valuation column.

SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;

--974455790000


What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

Return the maximum amount of money raised.

SELECT MAX(raised) FROM startups;

-- 11500000000

Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.

SELECT MAX(raised) 
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';

-- 1800000


In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;

-- 1994

Return the average valuation.

SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;

--15974685081.9672


Return the average valuation, in each category.

SELECT AVG(valuation), category
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

Return the average valuation, in each category.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;


Return the average valuation, in each category.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowes

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
