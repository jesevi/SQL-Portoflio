Create a table named friends with three columns:

id that stores INTEGER
name that stores TEXT
birthday that stores DATE

-- CREATE TABLE friends (id INTEGER, name TEXT, birthday DATE);


Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends.

Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.

--INSERT INTO friends VALUES (1, "Ororo Munroe", '1940-05-30');

Add two of your friends to the table.

Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.

-- INSERT INTO friends VALUES(2, "Vanessa Ramirez", '1991-09-05');
INSERT INTO freinds VALUES (3, "Gaby Ramirez", '1994-02-09');


Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”.

Update her record in friends.

--UPDATE friends
  SET name = 'Storm'
  WHERE id = 1;
  
Add a new column named email.

-- SELECT * FROM friends;
  ALTER TABLE friends
  ADD COLUMN email TEXT;
  

Update the email address for everyone in your table.

Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com.

-- UPDATE friends
  SET email = 'storm@codecademy.com'
  WHERE id = 1;
